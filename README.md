# Learning about Version Control
author: Sandra Gross
Solving merge conflicts takes conscious effort, but I can do it!
What I really like about version control is that it makes collaboration much easier. Everyone can contribute to a project by working on it independently.
What I dislike is that as a beginner using version control is often not intuitive in its usage and thus it may rather seem confusing than helpful.
